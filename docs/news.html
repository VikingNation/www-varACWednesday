        November 30th 20:31 UTC</br></br>
        We are in the closing hours of our public beta Superstation Contest. The contest runs from 11/17 through 11/30. We have received reports that Superstation ended counting early, that is before 0000Z on 12/1. The end date is 0000Z on the last day. We told everyone to select 11/30 in error. Please go into Settings and changed the end date to 12/1/2025. This will end Superstation at 0000Z on 12/1.</br></br>
        We will post instructions later this evening on how you can send us your logs.</br></br>

        <h2>It's a Stranger VarAC Wednesday</h2>
        <p>
        November 25, 2025</br></br>
        The shack was quiet until the static roared to life. Dustin leaned closer, eyes wide. “The signal… it’s trying to break through.”</br>
        Across town, Lucas caught the same faint pulse: “There’s a date hidden in it… November 26th.”</br>
        Mike’s voice cut through: “This isn’t noise. It’s a call. We need to connect.”</br>
        Max grinned, sliding into the chair: “It’s VarAC Wednesday! If we all push our signals, we can build the SUPERSTATION!"</br>
        So mark your calendars, operators — tomorrow is Wednesday, November 26th. Fire up your rigs, tune your antennas, and join the mission. Together we’ll cut through the static and make waves across the air. Be sure to check-in tomorrow and join the "Upside Down Radio Corp". The heroes of Stranger Things need your check-in to battle against the evil forces of Vecna and his minions</br></br>

        <h2>Announcing SUPERSTATION!</h2>
        <p>
        October 16, 2025</br></br>
        Jason (K3JSJ) and I (KB0US) are excited and jazzed to announce a new game/contest coming very soon for VarAC.</br></br>
        Superstation is Global VarAC Game that is played over an extended time frame. Everyone in the world participates on an equal footing.</br></br>

        The purpose of the SUPERSTATION game is to increase the number of VarAC QSOs and to encourage more DX activity. A typical game will run over multiple weeks although a game can be run at any length.</br></br>

        SUPERSTATION is different from any other amateur radio “contest.” There is an element of a card and dice game, promoting QSOs that are more than simple exchanges, and demonstrating the DX capabilities of the mode. All amateurs around the world are invited to participate.</br></br>

        SUPERSTATION is integrated into VarAC via the VarAC.db file allowing SUPERSTATION to read information about contacts you've made. The game does not use beacons in any way. But we do use Broadcast. How? Well . . .</br></br>

        In the next few weeks, a SUPERSTATION page will appear on varacwednesday dot net. Here's where you'll find how to download the game software, a game manual. and a YouTube video to demonstrate how to play the game. Of course, we'll let you know when the page is available.</br></br>

        Software Requirements: SUPERSTATION runs on a Windows 10 or 11 computer. SUPERSTATION runs as a single executable. You must have at least VarAC version 12.0.
        We would like a few more beta testers and if you're interested, email varacwednesday@gmail.com.</br></br>
