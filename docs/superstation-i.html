        <h2>VarAC SUPERSTATION I Contest set for January 14th - 28th, 2026</h2>
        <p>
        The global VarAC community is excited for the initial running of the SUPERSTATION game. Unlike most amateur radio contests, SUPERSTATION encourages long form QSOs of at least ten minutes over an extended period of time. The game is unique in that it combines having QSOs with a card &amp; dice game as well as the distance of the longest QSO during the contest period.
        </p>
        <p>
        The high scorer will receive a beautiful full color plaque. The contest’s official sponsor is QRP Labs.
        </p>
        <p>
        VarAC provides error free keyboard to keyboard communication. Built upon the VARA HF modem, QSOs of -20dB can be achieved. VarAC and SUPERSTATION are free applications. VARA HF is free as well although higher performance can be unlocked with a $75.00 license.

            <h2>RULES</h2>
            <p align="left">

            <ol style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap:10px;">
              <li>The SUPERSTATION I contest runs from 0000Z January 14 through 2359Z January 28, 2026.</li>

              <li>Users must configure VarAC and SUPERSTATION per documentation.
                <ol type="a" style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap:10px;">
                  <li>Users must RESTART (Game → Restart) SUPERSTATION before the first contest QSO or &lt;ROLL&gt;.</li>
                  <li>Users must also set the Start and End Dates (File → Setup).</li>
                  <li>Users must configure their grid square in Superstation (File → Setup).</li>
                  <li>All users must provide a valid working email address when generating the Cabrillo log.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>

              <li>To have a score greater than zero, you must play the SUPERSTATION dice and card game until you have built out your virtual station with antenna, radio, computer, and amplifier cards.</li>

              <li>All valid SUPERSTATION QSOs made during the contest period count toward your final score. You may, therefore, make QSOs while you are building out your virtual station.</li>

              <li>You can only play the SUPERSTATION dice and card game three times per day. The maximum you can score is 256, which is the SUPERSTATION.</li>

              <li>To be counted as a valid SUPERSTATION QSO, it must be greater than 10 minutes and each QSO participant must have at least four lines of keyboard‑to‑keyboard typed text. These lines are considered human‑to‑human.</li>

              <li>The goal of SUPERSTATION is to encourage human‑to‑human QSOs. The following types of lines are allowed and count toward the 10‑minute time; however, they are scored as human‑to‑machine and do not count toward the four‑line human‑to‑human count.
                <ol type="a" style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap:10px;">
                  <li>Signal reports</li>
                  <li>&lt;TAGS&gt; that result in responses from unattended stations (e.g., INFO, LOCR, etc.)</li>
                  <li>VMAILs</li>
                  <li>AI chat lines</li>
                  <li>Messages from the VarAC application (CONNECT, DISCONNECT, etc.)</li>
                </ol>
              </li>

              <li>Rule 7 does not preclude you from using tags during a QSO; it just means they don’t count for the four lines of human‑to‑human text.</li>

              <li>You must log QSOs in the VarAC application in order for them to be counted towards SUPERSTATION QSOs. You must include the grid square of your QSO participant in order for that distance to be considered as a distance multiplier.  The grid square must be provided prior to logging.  There is no way to go back and add the grid square after the QSO is logged.</li>
              <li>SUPERSTATION computes the total score as:<br>
                SCORE = (value of your Virtual Station, 0–256) × (# of QSOs ≥ 10 minutes) × (maximum distance of a single human‑to‑human contact)
              </li>

              <li>Go to <a href="https://www.varacwednesday.net/superstation.html">https://www.varacwednesday.net/superstation.html</a> and follow the instructions for submitting your Cabrillo log. Logs must be submitted by 2359Z January 30, 2026.</li>

              <li>SUPERSTATION exists to promote fellowship among amateurs around the world. It is unsportsmanlike to game the system (e.g., scheduled repetitive QSOs, robot stations, falsified grid squares).</li>

              <li>SUPERSTATION includes software to score QSOs as human‑to‑human or human‑to‑machine. Contest participants shall not modify software or bypass scoring.</li>

              <li>SUPERSTATION users shall not modify the Cabrillo log output. Prohibited activities include falsifying QSOs, altering human‑to‑human scoring, modifying points, or changing QSO duration.</li>

              <li>Contest operators may require participants to update scoring software during the contest. Logs generated without the required version will not be accepted.</li>

              <li>The top 3 scorers will be requested to provide the Debug Log for the contest period (Game → Show Log).</li>

              <li>Software requirements and gameplay details can be found at <a href="https://www.varacwednesday.net/superstation.html">https://www.varacwednesday.net/superstation.html</a>.</li>

              <li><b>Cabrillo logs with missing, incomplete, or erroneous requested data or saved in an incorrect format will result in a disqualification. Logs not saved as CALLSIGN.CBR as described in the instructions will also result in a disqualification.</b></li>

              <li>When organizers determine log checking is complete, results are final and no further corrections or inquiries will be accepted.</li>
            </ol>
