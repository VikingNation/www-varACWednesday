    <h2>What is VarAC Wednesday?</h2>
    <p>VarAC Wednesday is a weekly amateur radio digital net where users check-in by sending a message via a station providing EMAIL gateway service.</p>

   <h2>How do I compose the check-in message?</h2>
   <p>Open VarAC and click the VMAIL button. Click the "Send as email" check-box.  Type "varacwednesday@gmail.com" in the "To" line.  Add a comma and type an email address to receive a copy.  The copy is used to verify your VMAIL was delivered from the VarAC gateway to the Internet. Next, type a reply to address.  Fill out the subject line and message portion based upon what is required for the given check-in week.</p>

   <p>The following is an example standard check-in message</p>

   <h2>Sending your message through an Email Gateway</h2>
   <p align="left">You will need to send your check-in through a VarAC station that provides email gateway service.

   <ul align="left">
   <li>Identify a clear slot to pass your email to a beacon. Using the Slot Sniffer in the CALL CQ menu is probably easiest although some will just look at their panadapter.</li>
   <li>Return to calling frequency.</li>
   <li>Connect to a beacon displaying the Email Gateway <img src="assets/images/email_gateway_icon.png" alt="icon"> icon.</li>
   <li>Send a QSY request to the beacon for the slot you identified as open.</li>
   <li>You and the beacon both automatically move to the open slot.</li>
   <li>The email is automatically transferred.</li>
   <li>Disconnect when the email is transferred.</li>
   </ul>

   </br>
   <p align="left">The entire process should look like this:</p>

   <p>
   <img src="/assets/images/Example_VMAIL_delivery.png" alt="example VMAIL delivery" />
   </p>

   <p align="left">
   VarAC will likely display a number of information pop-ups that will clear themselves 
   automatically. You do not need to manually clear these. In fact, if both you and the beacon are set up 
   correctly, you should not have to touch the keyboard after sending the QSY request; everything should 
   continue automatically up until you need to click DISCONNECT or send a <DISC> to the beacon.
   </p>

   <h2>When do I send my check-in message?</h2>
   <p align="left">Send your email every Wednesday between 0000 and 2400 your local time.</p>

   <h2>Additional information</h2>
   <ul align="left">
	   <li>Check-ins who do not use a VarAC EMAIL GATEWAY will not be counted.</li>
	   <li>You must be at on at least V11.0.7</li>
	   <li>YOU DO NOT NEED AN EMAIL GATEWAY ON YOUR INSTALLATION OF VarAC TO CHECK IN!  You will be using the EMAIL GATEWAY of the beacon displaying the email gateway icon that 
		   you connect with.</li>
	   <li>In V11.2.0 and above, canned messages are available in the VMAIL dialog box making 
	   participation in VarAC Wednesday even easier!
